08/11. So I arrived in Santiago on Friday the 28th of October around 4pm. Felt as happy to arrive than I did last year... It's like you sort of feel elated as you walk the last few kms into town after Monte de Gozo. And then the music stops...

As last year, the hardest part starts now. Like last year, the Camino came with more questions than answers and although some things are clearer, some others are not.

But first you have to look hard for a pilgrim or two you know to celebrate a bit. Since I did a 100 kms in 2 days, most of the pilgrims I was walking with haven't arrived yet... Oh well I'll have to stay a couple of days, I'm in no rush. I'll see most of them eventually.

(17 at the table that evening I think)

No extra walk to Finisterra either. As last year, after 50+ days, it feels like you have arrived and it is enough. This year the forecast is brilliant (versus dreadful last year), but really it has little to do with that. Like last year a couple pilgrims keep going.

(Victor shows up, accolades with everybody.)

So what about the Primitivo? Well I did it with a small injury on a knee ligament which prevented me from going longer stages, except the last 2 days when it was a lot better. It's much harder to split the Primitivo stages also, it's like do 20 or 30 km, but you have nowhere to stop in the middle... And every day is up and down (think O Ceibreiro everyday), so really unless you fancy 40+ km in the mountains you are doing the same stages as everyone else... That being said, the scenery is fantastic. Great views.

So compared to the Frances? More physical, yes I lost more weight this year that last year. More asphalt (Hello Cantabria), but also more mountains, beaches... All in all, taking in consideration that the first one had that novelty about it, I'd just say it's different. Not better nor worse, just different. People on the Norte/Primitivo often fear that they'll be too many pilgrims on the Frances. True but you still end up walking at your rhythm (me anyway) and alone most of the time, it's only when you stop that you see that there is indeed more pilgrims. That's my take anyway.

(Better put it in the right position! ;))

Biggest differences for me this year were:



	
  * By far being online rather than totally offline last year. Being offline allows you that big cut from everyday life. I walked. Stopped where I wanted. Sometimes in good albergues, sometimes in bad ones. I read 5-6 books last year (vs 0 this year) and not having whatapp or facebook didn't prevent me from meeting people again (Fargus, Enrico, Rose, Juliana...). You just meet the people that walk the same distance as you every other day. **Cutting more of your usual habits and anchors to the normal world allows the camino to have a deeper effect on you.** I definitely would recommend offline to everybody, or like 23/24hrs in airplane mode.

	
  * The part with little Albergues/GÃ®tes in France was not nice. I though that walking mostly alone for a month would allow me to reach a more relaxed state quicker. Wrong. Unless you also decide that you'll pitch your tent wherever you decide to stop and carry your food, then you have to look where you'll be staying this evening and the options are (somewhat to very) limited. I had the numbers of people ready to host pilgrims but that was unreliable, campings were also sparse at one stage... And you end up woorying about that it instead of feeling relaxed. Don't think I'll ever do it again but if I do... no shower / wild camping / cooking on the cards for me.

	
  * The rest? Mehhh not really. The camino is the camino, you walk the walk.




So I'm back in France for a bit now, have to decide what I'll be doing now (I end up with less certainties than when I started. :S). I just have that advantage that I have the experience of coming back once already. I know readjusting will be tough.
