So I won't go back to the French side of the border... Basically the way of Tours was pretty much like earlier, only with a few more pilgrims and more municipal albergues to make it easier. 

Oh and I had to buy a new backpack as the old one was about to give up... and then new shoes because the old ones had 2500+ km in them and well...

As for the way itself south of Bordeaux was flat flat flat. Fields of corn or Pine forest for a few days...

Yes days of that. Food was good though.

And then it got a little better before the border and then you cross into Euskadi (basque country) and on the first day you see there are pilgrims on theses shores.

And oh it's not flat. So not flat that the Camino often has steps going up and down on these first few days.

But when you go up well, the views get better, especially when the sea is also just there. And when it's not there it's not far. :)

And then there is Spanish food. Yum. Including my daily fuel : tortilla de patatas.

And then some views, and some pilgrims (Adam from NZ featured)

So differences with the Camino Frances?

- more up and down everyday. In the basque country it's about +/- 500m daily, and the basque like them steep. A bit less so in Cantabria.

- more distance between albergues, but still a lot easier than France. Loads of little shops and same for bars and restaurants.

(2 hospitaleros with me. Thanks Isaac and Javier!)

- More asphalt. Especially in Cantabria. :( Not so bothering in Euskadi but I'm glad to be finished with Cantabria!)

(Cantabria for you...)

- They should rename it the Camino Alleman! More than half the pilgrims I've met are Germans. :)

- There are pilgrims, but less so than the Frances. You can walk all day without meeting one. But usually you do.

(Lydia and Alex, nice couple from Andalusia)

- No long straight Camino, or not so much. Much more populated around here... No pilgrim time, only Spanish time. The menu is starting at 8pm or later, not before!

So what now? Just arrived in Asturias today and I've about 500 km left to Santiago. Maybe less since I intend to take the Primitivo in Oviedo, but that'll be harder.

(Asturias, today, suddenly a lot less asphalt! :D)

(I just like this picture... Odd Street)

So I should reach Santiago in 15 to 20 days. And maybe this year I'll go on to Finisterre...
