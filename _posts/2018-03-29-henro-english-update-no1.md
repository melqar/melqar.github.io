Eventually a little word and not too many spelling mistakes at this ungodly hour of the night.

So I went to Shikoku, Japan to walk the 88 temples pilgrimage, the 'henro'.

Weather: after a few rainy days at the start it now is 18Â° and sunny everyday... except that latitude wise this is Morocco so it's subtropical and hence humid. Hard for me. Thank god I came in march. Oh and cherry tree blossom season.

Food: Japan. Need I say more? Look at the pictures in those french updates!

Moutains: So japanese mountains in 2 words... drumroll... forest and steep. You expecting that nice hilly forest trail? take those steep steps instead!

The henro: Hard on your feet. Getting used to it now, but the Henro is 1200km and 90+% is asphalt. But mostly on quiet roads where you can see 'rural' japan. (Rural as in we wouldn't call that rural in europe).

The people: Some are very supportive of you and even more when they know you're walking. They offer gifts you cannot refuse (so far oranges, money, cake, coffee, wine, milk, oranges, mandarines, sweets, good advice and... more oranges and mandarines. Yes they grow those around here.) And most don't speak english so you don't know what they are saying. This is the most frustrating bit.

Hut jam full of origami, puppets and drawings. Oh and she offered coffee and cake too.

I mostly camp (got a tent yes). did some local accommodation but every night it gets expensive, so camping mostly and a nice place every couple of days to wash clothes, charge batteries... write blog. ;)

I should add more but I'm tired. Leave comments if you want me to talk about something.
