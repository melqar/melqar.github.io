So I started this year about 50k south from Cherbourg (my dad's village) and I started fast (too fast) to catch the end of the big tide to cross the bay to the Mont Saint-Michel (that yoke behind me up there, and under there too)

Fantastic crossing, can only recommend it. But by then the sole of my feet was already in a pretty bad state... And that's when silly pilgrim striked and decided to rest his feet by... doing 45k in a day. Let's just say they didn't like it and I had to stop and take the train forward 50k (home) to rest for 10 days.

(Quite a lot of dirt/gravel track by the river since the restart.)

So they kinda looked ok then and I restarted from home... yes slower and with last year tried and tested shoes. It's been ok since, I can see the skin of my sole recovering (with plenty of Nok cream love) and I'm now doing close to 30k a day, even did 40k 2 days ago. Feet tired but ok.

(German pilgrim with her dog, which walks long distances without paws problems)

Differences with the Spanish Camino : I've met about 5 pilgrims since the start, most (3) going to the Mont Saint-Michel (also a pilgrimage).

(Oh and food too, that was yesterday)

So no pilgrims : well very few alberges, no little snack places every few km (some villages yes, some no), basically you have to try a lot harder to find food and a sleeping spot.

(A few nice sites on the way as well)

Not many camping site lately, which leaves hotels (too expensive) and the people that host pilgrims for a night. (Very nice but unreliable, and I don't want to spend my time on the phone trying to contact them)

(And some lonely roads too...)

Soon I'll be joining with the Tours Way and I should have an easier time then as there should be a few more pilgrims but still not enough for a 'pilgrim economy'. That's only on the Le Puy way in France. You have been warned!

(And the nice people who host you in their home and feed you diner and breakfast... Thanks to them all.)

That problem will disappear at the border though, even though I do the Camino del Norte then Primitivo, I should be ok for alberges there. That'd be in like 500+km... üòÅ
